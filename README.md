RATS Procedures
==============

This is a colection of my RATS procedures (https://www.estima.com/).

They are provided as they are, without any guarantee. You are free to use them or modifying at your own wish.

Some of them are interrelated, so the best strategy is to download all of them to the same directory and include the file ‘**FJG.fjg**’, with the correct path, in the *Procedure Library* file option on the *Directories* tab in the **RATS Preferences** window. This should load all the procs when WinRATS is started.

Sintax and documentation for the procs are in a text file, '``proc name``.**txt**', under de *Doc* folder.

Feel free to contact me if you have any inquire about the procs.
